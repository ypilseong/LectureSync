LectureSync is an advanced platform that converts lecture recordings into summarized text and offers an interactive Q&A system powered by state-of-the-art speech-to-text and natural language processing technologies, enabling users to quickly access and comprehend key information while facilitating deeper engagement with educational content.

### Key Features

- **Summarization:** Automatically generates summaries from lecture recordings, making it easier to review and study key points.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Integrates with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to allow users to ask questions about the content and receive accurate answers based on the uploaded material.
- **Multi-format Support:** Upload videos, audio files, or PDFs to create an interactive learning experience.
- **Contextual Search:** Enables users to search within the uploaded content, with the ability to locate and play back the specific segments of video where relevant questions are discussed.
- **Google STT API:** Utilizes Googleâ€™s Speech-to-Text API for precise transcription of spoken content.
